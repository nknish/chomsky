# chomsky
##colorless green ideas sleep furiously


This is a work in progress. For now, if you want to try it out (for mac):

- download the repo
- move the executable file `chomsky` to /usr/local/bin
- move the directory `words` to /usr/local/share
- hopefully it will work!

lists of words from [here](http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html) for now.
